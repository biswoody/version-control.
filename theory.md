1.Explain the Git Workflow 

 The Git workflow consists of several steps that help manage and track changes in a repository. Here’s a detailed explanation: 
 1. Clone the Repository: Copy an existing repository to your local machine using git clone. 
 2. Create a Branch: Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix using git branch or git checkout -b. 
 3. Make Changes: Modify the codebase in your working directory. 
 4. Stage Changes: Add changes to the staging area using git add. 
 5. Commit Changes: Save your changes to the local repository using git commit. 
 6. Push Changes: Upload your changes to the remote repository using git push. 
 7. Create a Pull Request: Request to merge your changes into the main branch. 
 8. Review and Merge: Have your changes reviewed and, if approved, merge them into the main branch. 

2.How to Clone a Repository 

 To clone a repository, use the following command: git clone <repository_url>
 For example: git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git 
 This command creates a local copy of the repository on your machine. 

3.How to Check the Status of Your Git Repository 
To check the status of your repository, use: git status This command shows the current state of the working directory and staging area, including untracked files, changes not staged for commit, and changes ready to be committed. 

4.How to Stage and Commit Changes 
 To stage changes, use: git add <file> 
 To stage all changes, use: git add . 
 To commit changes, use: git commit -m "Your commit message" 

5.How to Create a New Branch 
 To create a new branch, use: git branch <branch_name> Or create and switch to a new branch in one step: git checkout -b <branch_name> 

6.Explain the Concept of Git Branching Strategy 
 A Git branching strategy is a workflow or set of conventions for how branches are used and managed within a project. Common strategies include: 
 • Feature Branching: Each new feature is developed in its own branch. 
 • Gitflow: Uses multiple branches like main, develop, feature, release, and hotfix. 
 • GitHub Flow: A simpler strategy with main and short-lived feature branches. 

7. How to Switch to a Different Branch 
 To switch to a different branch, use: git checkout <branch_name> 

8. How to Merge One Branch into Another 
 To merge one branch into another, first switch to the target branch: git checkout <target_branch> Then merge the other branch into it: git merge <source_branch> 

9. What is a Merge Conflict and How to Resolve It 
 A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically resolve differences between branches. To resolve it: 
 1. Identify the conflicted files using git status. 
 2. Open the conflicted files and manually resolve the conflicts. 
 3. Mark the conflicts as resolved with git add <file>. 
 4. Commit the resolved changes with git commit. 

10.Why Branching is Important in Git 
 Branching allows developers to work on different features, bug fixes, or experiments in isolation without affecting the main codebase. It enables parallel development and makes it easier to manage and review changes. 

11.What is a Pull Request (PR) and What is Its Purpose? 
 A pull request (PR) is a request to merge changes from one branch into another, typically from a feature branch into the main branch. It allows team members to review, discuss, and approve changes before they are merged, ensuring code quality and collaboration. 

12.Explain the Concept of ‘Forking’ in GitHub 
 Forking is creating a personal copy of someone else’s repository on your GitHub account. It allows you to experiment and make changes without affecting the original repository. You can later submit a pull request to propose your changes to the original repository. 

13.How to Find a Specific Commit in the History 
 To find a specific commit, use: git log. This command displays the commit history. 
You can also search for a commit by its message, author, or hash using: git log --grep="search_term" 
Or for more detailed search: 
git log --author="author_name"
